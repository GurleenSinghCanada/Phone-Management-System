<h2>Description</h2>
The Phone Management System is a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project designed to efficiently manage contacts and call history. It includes fields such as ContactName for storing contact names, ContactType for categorizing contacts, MissedCall to track unanswered calls, and Favourite for marking important contacts. DateCalled and TimeCalled allow users to record call details, while ContactPicture lets them associate images with contacts. This system enables users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts, and it provides a convenient way to keep track of call history, prioritize contacts, and personalize the experience with contact pictures. It simplifies contact and call management for enhanced user convenience
